# TeamLimit Plugin for Counter-Strike 2

**TeamLimit** is a CounterStrikeSharp plugin for Counter-Strike 2 that restricts the number of players per team (Terrorist and Counter-Terrorist) to ensure balanced gameplay. When a player attempts to join a full team, they are moved to spectator mode, hear an error sound, and receive a chat message (with a cooldown to prevent spam). Perfect for PUG, MIX, or Retake servers.

## Features
- Configurable maximum players per team via `TeamLimit.json`.
- Moves players to spectator mode when they try to join a full team.
- Plays the CS2 sound `sounds/ui/weapon_cant_buy.vsnd` on failed join attempts.
- Sends a chat message (e.g., "The Terrorist team is full!") with a 10-second cooldown per team to prevent spam.
- Debug logging to the server console for troubleshooting.
- Compatible with CounterStrikeSharp v1.0.340 (September 2025).

   ```
   Output: `bin/Release/net8.0/TeamLimit.dll`

4. **Deploy to Server**:
   - Copy `TeamLimit.dll` to:
     ```
     game/csgo/addons/counterstrikesharp/plugins/TeamLimit/TeamLimit.dll
